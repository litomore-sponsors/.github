## Hi There, I'm LitoMore ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons), [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js), [Flat](https://github.com/netless-io/flat), [Alfy](https://github.com/sindresorus/alfy), [Listr](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/listr) and some other projects you might rely on.

I'm also active on [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk), [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), [meow](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow) and some other projects.

In the past, I have created many [Fanfou projects](https://github.com/fanfoujs) and also participated in the management of the Fanfou community. But now I'm trying more possible directions. And I created the new universe [fanfou.social](https://fanfou.social) for Fanfouers. This is a time machine that allows Fanfouers to move their statuses from Fanfou to [fanfou.social](https://fanfou.social).

As an open-sourcerer, I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of giving back to the community. Your support not only helps me financially, but it also motivates me to continue working on these projects and making them better.

I also like collecting games and toys. In the future, I'm planning to share my collections and experiences through publishing articles, videos, or live streaming.
